##  Dungeons and Dragons Website 

## UX / UI
**Project Goals**

The main aim of the Role for initiative website is to aid in the conversion of customers from our socials and other marketing to our business. We want to create a method of funnelling customers from other channels directly to registration. Roll for initiative has two main audiences. Advanced Gamers and Beginners of all ages. 

**User goals** 

Our client base can vary in age however they all have a common interest in he game itself.

**Client goals are:**

* Advanced/Dungeon Masters - see we have enough knowledge to host games at their level 

* Beginners, Gamers and Friends of Players - Gather information and feel you are in a safe space to get involved

* Adavanced players need the confidence that there skills will be catered to, and they arent just going to be placed in a slower game with beginners.

* Beginners need to know they arent just going to be thrown in at the deepend and unable to pick the game up at their own pace. 

* Friends of players can be harder to cater for, the level of knwoeledge their friend holds may be vast so a different approach will be required to please both players.

**The new website will be _Perfect_ for this! it will meet all these needs by:**

* Conducting extensive UI research and providing early access deployment to get live feedback as it comes into creation. 

* Find out what people want to know and then present it in an easy to navigate method showcasing the services. 

* Offer seamless navigation without having to leave the page or go back. 

* Include eye catching images to engage the viewer and then suck them further in with calls to action and information. 

* provide clear information around events to get the client thinking about joining and already planning. 

* Have clear differences in games to show we cater for all.


## Developer and Busines Goals

* Use a topic that I know and enjoy to ensure i can really sink my teeth into it. 

* Make it work on multiple screen sizes and adapt as well as making sure all links work to showcase the knowledge. 

* Use styles and good photos to showcase a professional looking website that isnt over complicated to put prioirty on building customer base.

# Design Choices 

The website needs to have well thought out images and intuitive design in order to engage the client and feed their thirst to find out more.

**Fonts**

* The primary font is from google fonts - Im Fell English with a static fall back, I trialed server fonts and complete user research which lead to a change in the fonts used. 

**icons**

* I have used Font Awesome to upload icons to my design, I mixed these between easily recognisable options e.g. Facebook, Youtube etc and, some quirky ones i feel linked with the topic of the website. 

**colours**

* I used lighter colours for the text in order to help it remain readable while using dark and darker / colourful images, this creates good contrast. 

* I used a colour pallet found online to make sure my colours worked together with some matching colours from other pallets on their site. Link to the sample section: [https://colorhunt.co/palette/511d43901e3edc25259bc09c](#sample-section).

**Styling**

* I used the styling id learned from the topics to make my event times shape to the screen and give an easy to digest method of information gathering from the home page. 

* I found a perfect circle image with great resolution but it downloaded as a sqaure, the information in the love running project helped this resolution look great on the website however, it also made the other photos poor resolution stretched due to this they were changed.

* I styled all of my links to socials using Font Awesome and used symbols that are instantly recognisable. 

**Background**

* The Hero image is the main background on the home screen, This image does cut off in certain areas depending on screen size however is still clear and gives an insight into what to expect even cut down. 

* I have used shadow boxes learned from the training in order to ensure information formatted ontop saves space but also can still be easily read. 

* The gallery pages whole background breaks down photos depending on screen size this way none of the photos are stretched and the background takes up the whole screen. 

* The image used in the background of the page has been changed a couple of times due to looking for something that suits and is enticing. The final image used meets both of these. Old image used was too dark [https://live.staticflickr.com/5728/23094214563_e0bc14db5f_b.jpg]

**Wire Frames**

**Credits**

I mainly used the projects completed in order to aid my project, i relied on help from the love running project and rereviewed the HTML and CSS topics while i went to ensure code was correctly typed. 

On a occasion i used material such as the for specifications and wesite positioning from the past training. This helped to make sure everything was evenly spaced out and readable. 

All images where used from the above sources. 

# Bugs discovered

* Register page hero image doesnt cover full page, leaves a white space between image and top of page. 

* Font shows on preview but doenst pull through to deployment.

* Home page hero image cut off at the top rather than being more centered.

* text on left hand side shows as lower than right on full screen.

* I couldnt get the messager symbol to pull acorss to all pages, i spent a lot of time trying to resolve this in the index.html and the style.css documents before i realised this was due to the inital header and footer being copied before I added the messenger option code copied over and fixed issues. This also help me realise that issue was stopping the icon after the header. 

* At first I was creating a website for Yoga Classes but noticed a personal bud and wanted to more focus on something i felt i could engage better with. This also followed further discussion with friends and family which confirmed my new purpose. 

*I used favicons and tested a few of these in practice. These varied from images converted from photos and stock favicons however it was hard to find on that looked good at such a small size which was also noticable and relevant. I moved away from image conversions as this seemed too difficult to view all detail when shrunk. following user research I decided on the used Die.

* I realised part way through that one of my main goals was to create open and easy communciation after creating the site user research taught me that a direct message option would massively improve this, using icons everyone knows and loves to create an open channel.

* During the project I found it a struggle to remember to save changes and push at times in order to directly impact the early deployment so I could show people to get live feedback, through the process i truly learned the method to pull through changes rather than changing the code itself. this helped me with deployment and UI. 

* Throughout the process there were multiple images used to check how they looked and scrapped, this was due to inconsistent resolution of images which looked great in some spaces but not in others. I tested these images on different screens and practiced throughout the project making sure the end product met mine and the users needs.
