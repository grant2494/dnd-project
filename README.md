## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to entice the customer with intriguing images and quick easily digestible information. The imagery high resolution colour, I tested different backgrounds but white had the best contrast. 

### Colour  

For he colour scheme I worked with the images used to ensure the text was readable and inviting. I used color palette I tested the colours to get a good contrast and user tested this.

### Fonts

I tested multiple fonts and even completed some user research following deployment but ended by using 'Im fell English'  with a static fall back. I was going to use a second font but found that this kept the page consistent.
<br> 
I used 'Cinzel Decorative' and left it in the software to make it easy to amend should intended the website owner want to switch out the fonts. 

### Structure
The page is structured in a way that makes it easily useable and interaction friendly, its navigation aligns with other sites to make it easier and more digestible without explanation. The website has three pages that cover:
- A home page showing upcoming games as well as some information on what to expect. 
- A gallery page which shows images of both online and in person games which will build going forward. 
- A contact page which entices users to reach out and get involved.
